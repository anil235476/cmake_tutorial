commenting:-
   line starting with # is commenting

cmake version mentioning:-
	cmake_minimum_required (VERSION numberhere)
project name 
		project(project_name)
defining type of application
		as exe:-
			add_executable(name list of files here)
		as library:-
		    static library(default setting is STATIC)
			add_library(name STATIC "list of files here")
			dynamic library
			add_library(name SHARED "list of files here")
		
Adding compile time Flag:-
		//let us say we want add compile time flag with name TEST 
		add_definitions(-DTEST)

linking one exe to library:-
        //test -> exe name 
		//testlib --> library name
		target_link_libraries(test testlib)

setting normal variable, enviornment varible, or cache variable:-
		set(<variable> <value>... [PARENT_SCOPE])
		//what is the use of set(...)
		a. setting list of files to variable.
		
How to access variable value:-
		${variable_name}
		
adding standard library say windows specific:-
         //here we try to add d3d11.lib file
		target_link_libraries(directX_renderer d3d11)
		//note: it is case sensitive, if D3D11 is given then there would be compilation error
		
directory path of project:-
         ${CMAKE_HOME_DIRECTORY} -- > identifies the project directory path
		 
deciding binary exe and obj file directory:-
          CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY this flag represents directory.
		  whatever path we want to give to output directory, this variable value hs to be set.
		  for example
		  set(CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY ${CMAKE_HOME_DIRECTORY}/bin/)
		  
deciding library out put directory:-
        CMAKE_LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY represents library output directory.
		whatever output directory is required, set this variable as desired value of directory.
		for example:-
		set(CMAKE_LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY ${CMAKE_HOME_DIRECTORY}/bin/)
		
adding subdirectory in the build:-
		add_subdirectory((source_dir)
		Add a subdirectory to the build. 
		The source_dir specifies the directory in which the source CMakeLists.txt and code files are located.
		
how to specify target platform:-(x86 or x64)
			by default cmake generate build for x86.
			however for other than x86,this has to be put into command line argument when cmake is run
			for example:-
			cmake .\ -G "Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64"
			explanation:- in this case build is generated for Visual Studio 14 2015 with x64 archietuecture support.

how to make conditional inclusion(selection) in cmake run enviornment:-
			use case:-
					When it is required to ON of some cmake part.
			option(variable_name, " comment ", [initial value])
			option variable can have ON or OFF.
			to set variable:-
			during running cmake from command line 
			cmake -Dvariable_name=ON[or OFF]
			
adding testing framework:-
			ctest is provided by cmake, ctest can run gtest.
			how to use:-
				it is being on by using two apis:
				 enable_testing() and 
				 add_test()
		    How to run
				go to subdiretory of runsystem
				and 
				run ctest

Building
	CMake supports out-of-source builds?—?so all our compiled code goes into a directory separate to the sources.
	mkdir _build
	cd _build
	cmake ..
	
List of cmake global variables:-
	(a) CMAKE_BINARY_DIR
			if you are building in-source, this is the same as CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR, otherwise this is the top level directory of your build tree
	(b) CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR
			this is the directory, from which cmake was started, i.e. the top level source directory
	(c) EXECUTABLE_OUTPUT_PATH
			set this variable to specify a common place where CMake should put all executable files (instead of CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR)
	(d) LIBRARY_OUTPUT_PATH
			set this variable to specify a common place where CMake should put all libraries (instead of CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR)
	(e) PROJECT_NAME
			the name of the project set by PROJECT() command.
	(f) PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR
			ontains the full path to the root of your project source directory, i.e. to the nearest directory where CMakeLists.txt contains the PROJECT() command.
